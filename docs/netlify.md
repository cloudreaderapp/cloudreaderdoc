## Publish your site

The easiest to start is to work on hosted site based on platform like Netlify or Vercel.

This will offer you off the shelf :
- site publication automated after each modification
- integration with a shared back-end on github.
- capabilities to edit/modify a page from the documentation site with the 'Edit this Page' button.

To proceed :

- Create an new account Github account if required on [Github Sign up](https://github.com/signup)
- Clone this repo {{ metada.gitRepo }}
- Create an new Netlify account if required 
	+ Go to [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) and choose 'Get Started for free' or just [Sign up](https://app.netlify.com/signup)
	+ Alternatively follow the [instruction](https://docs.netlify.com/get-started/)
- Follow instruction to create a new site with guidance from "Import from an existing repository" in [Add new site](https://docs.netlify.com/welcome/add-new-site/) documentation

Other contributors who may edit the pages need their own github account and you must include them in the github project.
